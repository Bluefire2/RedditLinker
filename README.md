## Overview
This bot has several commands, some of which have not yet been implemented but should be soon.

### Linking subs
The basic command is to link any Reddit subs mentioned in chat. Subs can be of the form /r/sub, r/sub, /R/sub or R/sub, and can be anywhere in the message text.

### New/hot/top posts

To find and link new, hot or top posts from a sub, simply type the name of the sub, followed by the post type, and the number of posts to fetch. To get top posts, further specify the time period (day, week, month, 6month, year or all). For example, `/r/nottheonion hot 5` fetches the top 5 hot posts from /r/nottheonion.

### Search sub

To search a sub for a certain query, type the sub name, the number of results, and the query. For example, to search for "cute kittens" in /r/cats and get the top 5 posts, use the command `/r/cats 5 cute kittens`.

[example coming soon]
